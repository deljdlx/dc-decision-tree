# 🌳 Decision Tree Builder

<!--<SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->
Build, Simulate & Export Dynamic Decision Trees

A **Proof of Concept** for an **interactive decision tree editor** with **real-time simulation** and **JSON export**.  
<!--</SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->

## **🔹 Features (Work in Progress)**
- 🧠 **Real-time simulation** → Test decisions dynamically with an interactive UI.
- 📄 **JSON Export & Import** → Save, share, and integrate decision trees in other applications.  
- ⚡ **Fast & lightweight** → Runs entirely in the browser, no backend required.  

## **💩 Disclaimer – This is just a POC!**
This project is **not finished** and **definitely not production-ready**.  

Missing features (aka, things I’ll "probably" fix one day):
- More polished UI/UX (because good looks matter)
- Error handling (right now, just don't break it, please)
- Optimizations for bigger trees (so your browser doesn’t cry)

💾 **Potential use cases (if I ever finish it)**
- Chatbot decision logic
- Workflow automation
- Interactive user guides
- Game branching narratives

🕹️ **Try the prototype (at your own risk 😆):**
